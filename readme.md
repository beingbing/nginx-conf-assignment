## nginx config files
This repository gives a custom setup for nginx as to how you can deploy a local project on your machine and use your machine as a server

# It includes- 
1. a custom made error 404 file
2. a custom made error 500 file
3. site-available/default file for the changes that are made in them.
4. nginx.conf file.

It might happen that you only need to customize only one of either nginx.conf file or site-available/default file then i will 
suggest you to go for nginx.conf file but i did changes in both due to some trouble in my local machine as it was not recognizing
any of them separately but only working when both were customize.

This repository is a part of my assignment.

Note: i kept custom404.html and custom500.html alongside index.html hence the same root for all of them but it can differ for you 
on your wish.
